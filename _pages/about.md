Welcome!

I am Rihuan Huang, a fifth-year PhD candidate in [Operations, Technology & Information Management](https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/areas/operations-technology-and-information-management/) at [Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/), [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). 

My current research interests include supply chain contracting, supply chain finance and sustainability. I use experimental methods to study these problems to generate managerial insights from a behavioral perspective.  In this website you can find more about my research and myself.
